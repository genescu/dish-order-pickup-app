simple app that allows each order to have one or more dishes. Each order is assigned a unique ID that the customer can use to identify their order.

When there are multiple dishes in an order, each dish is placed in a separate pickup box. This means that if an order has, for example, three dishes, there will be three pickup boxes with the same order ID.

On the screen, you can see the blueprint of the pickup box system, with each box numbered. The order ID is displayed on a box when there is a dish ready to be picked up. If a box does not have a dish assigned to it, it should be empty.
